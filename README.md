# Endless Wordle

This game is inspired by Wordle and is similar to the classic MasterMind game, but instead of colors, you'll be guessing words.

## Why Play?

* The original game only allows one word per day, but Endless Wordle offers limitless gameplay.
* Supports custom dictionary files for varied challenges.

## Demo

You can try it out on Glitch:

## How to Play

The objective is to guess the target word. For each guess, the game provides feedback on each letter:

* Green: The letter is in the correct position.
* Yellow: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
* No color: The letter is not in the target word.

All guesses must be valid words. The keyboard at the bottom will also highlight letter statuses: green for correct, dark gray for incorrect, and light gray for unused.
